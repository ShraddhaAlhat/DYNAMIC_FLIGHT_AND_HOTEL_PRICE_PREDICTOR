In Today's Dynamic Travel Market, Consumers struggle to discern the best times to book 
flight and hotel arrangements due to unpredictable price fluctuations influenced by seasonal 
demand, market trends, and availability. Existing solutions, such as price comparison 
websites and travel agents, lack the sophistication to accurately predict these fluctuations, 
leaving travellers at risk of overspending or missing out on savings. Thus, there is a pressing 
need for a comprehensive solution leveraging machine learning to analyse historical pricing
data, seasonal trends, and market demand, providing actionable insights for optimal booking 
times. The proposed Dynamic Flight and Hotel Price Predictor addresses this gap by 
employing advanced algorithms to forecast price trends accurately, offering personalized
